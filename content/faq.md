## Free HoneyBee Removal

100% free. You've found honeybees you don't want and I want to give them a new home. It's a win/win.

## 1. Contact a local beekeeper (like me)

We live and work in Utah County. Beekeeping is a hobby for us, however our schedules are very flexible. Call us as soon as you see a honeybee swarm.  

## 2. From a safe distance, take a picture and send it to us at 801-734-9481

A picture is worth a thousand words!  Plus a picture helps us bring the right tools to safely remove the bees. You don't need to get close, but it does help us understand the situation so we can bring the right tools. 

## 3. Go inside and keep an eye on the bees

Honeybees swarm because their old home got overcrowded. While that large ball of bees are hanging in you tree or bush protecting the queen, scout bees are flying out looking for a new home. If we catch them quickly, they won't move into someones chimeny or wall.

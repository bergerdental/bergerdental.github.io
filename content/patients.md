### **NEW PATIENTS** 
We are currently accepting new patients and look forward to taking care of your dental needs. If you have dental insurance, we would appreciate the chance to call and verify your insurance benefits with your insurance company BEFORE your first appointment so that your first visit will be a smooth one with no unexpected surprises.

Below is the patient information, medical history, consent and HIPAA forms which you can download to fill out and either bring with you to your appointment or send ahead of time.

At Berger Dental, we schedule one patient at a time so that we can concentrate on your treatment when you are here. Therefore, since we set time aside for you and do not schedule multiple people at a time, it is important that you keep your appointments or give 24 hours notice if you are unable to come.

The first appointment as a new patient is typically a comprehensive exam and full mouth set of x-rays (digital) and lasts from 45 minutes to an hour. We usually do NOT schedule a cleaning at the first appointment as there are several types and levels of cleanings. In order to respect everyone's time, we diagnose the type of cleaning and schedule it for the next appointment. At the end of the first appointment, a comprehensive treatment plan will be printed and explained and you are able to make appointments to begin treatment from there.

Feel free to [call](tel:9405661828) or [email](bergerdental@bergerdental.com) to make an appointment or with any questions.

#### Donna, our office manager, is well educated on insurance policies and can answer any of your questions.

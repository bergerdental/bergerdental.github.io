### Call or Text us
## [801-734-9481](tel:8017349481)

### **Our Honeybee Swarm Removal is 100% free.** 
You've found honeybees you don't want and we want to give them a new safe home. It's a win/win.

### 1. Contact a local beekeeper (like us)

We live and work in Utah County. Beekeeping is a hobby for us, however our schedules are very flexible. **Call/Text us as soon as you see a honeybee swarm.** It's best for all if we catch them, instead of waiting for them to leave on their own.  

### 2. From a safe distance, take a picture and send it to us at [801-734-9481](tel:8017349481)

**A picture is worth a thousand words!**  Plus a picture helps us bring the right tools to safely remove the bees. You don't need to get close, but it does help us understand the situation so we can bring the right tools. 

### 3. Go inside and keep an eye on the bees

Honeybees swarm because their old home gets too crowded.  The Old Queen along with about half of the hive "swarm" or leave the their old home for good. They typically land in in a tree or bush and make a large 'ball' of bees.  This ball of bees is made up mostly of female bees protecting their **one queen inside that ball**.  While most of the bees are protecting the queen, a few hundred 'scout bees' are sent out to look for a new permanant home. Sometime they can find a new home in hours and sometimes it takes 12+ hours.  If we are notified early and catch them, they won't move into someones chimeny, wall, or dryer vent.

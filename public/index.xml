      <description>Call/Text us at 801-734-9481 We&amp;rsquo;re a couple of local beekeepers that are serious about saving honeybees.
While bees are swarming, they are usually docile, however we recommend you leave them alone until we can get there and safely move them. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things you can do.
 Breath, we&amp;rsquo;ll be there soon. From a safe distance, take a picture, this will help us bring the right tools. Go inside and keep an eye on them (just incase they leave) We&amp;rsquo;ll let you know when we arrive and you can watch from a safe distance while we re-home the bees.</description>
